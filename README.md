Hi! I'm Taco and I'm a young, dumb, developer.

 ❤️ I like Jazz, coding and video-games.

 💭 Currently obsessed with graphics programming and experimenting with MonoGame!

 🎮 I want to make games. Every silly project I work on is done with the objective of learning more and developing a game I can be proud of.

 ⭐ Thanks for reading! <3
